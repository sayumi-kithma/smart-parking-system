**A comprehensive, automated parking management platform featuring real-time slot booking, digital wallets, ANPR gate simulation, and AI assistance.**

</div>

## 🌟 Overview

**NPark** is a modern web application designed to eliminate the friction of physical parking passes at university campuses. Built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase, the system streamlines vehicle registration, enforces domain-specific parking constraints, manages digital wallet payments via PayPal, and provides role-specific dashboards for Students, Security Personnel, Cashiers, and Administrators.

### Key Highlights

- **Role-Based Access Control** - Secure, distinct workflows for Students, Security, Cashiers, and Admins.
- **Digital Wallet & Payments** - Seamless wallet top-ups using the PayPal Sandbox API.
- **Automated Workflows** - OTP email verification via Resend and automated penalty tracking (3-strike rule).
- **Real-Time Monitoring** - Live parking slot availability and simulated ANPR gate processing.
- **ParkAI Assistant** - Built-in chatbot to help users navigate parking rules and domain constraints.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Supabase Setup
The application relies on a strictly normalized 3NF schema. The primary tables include `profiles`, `vehicles`, `parking_slots`, `wallets`, `transactions`, `bookings`, `complaints`, and `penalties`. Ensure your Supabase project has the latest migration files applied.

### Third-Party APIs
1. **PayPal:** Obtain Sandbox Client IDs from the PayPal Developer Dashboard for the wallet top-up flow.
2. **Resend:** Generate an API key from Resend to enable the OTP registration and email notification pipeline.

## 📖 Usage

### Registration & Login
1. Enter your valid university student email.
2. Check your email for the Resend OTP code.
3. Enter the OTP to automatically generate your user profile and digital wallet.

### Booking a Slot
1. Navigate to the interactive map on the Student Dashboard.
2. Select an available slot and confirm the vehicle type.
3. The system will calculate the fee, verify your wallet balance, and lock the slot.
